Iâ€™m a software developer for 6 years, I have experience with Fullstack Web development and ERP systems development. I worked on several projects for large companies in the technology sector, having experience in planning, developing and maintaining applications. I have knowledge and experience with C# (.Net), Python (Django, flask), Java (Spring) using them in the development of MVC applications and microservices, implementing unit tests (xUnit and JUnit) and front-end frameworks (Vue.js).

Most of the codes you will see here scripts that i use to automate boring stuff or for academic purposes, all of my professional work were on private repositories.

Some of my professional info are on my LinkedIn in the end of this README, feel free to take a look!
```See ya!```
