I have been working as a software developer for 3 years and I am always looking to learn new technologies and adapt myself to whatever is necessary for the team or for the development of the project, in the last year I had the opportunity to work as a developer in a big tech (Dell) where I learned many things that completely changed how I saw software development, I am passionate about this area and I am currently looking for new opportunities!

All my professional Info are on my LinkedIn in the end of this README, feel free to take a look!

Most of the codes you will see here scripts that i use to automate boring stuff.
```See ya!```
